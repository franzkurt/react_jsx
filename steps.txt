	Success! Created linx at tmp/react/linx
	Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

	  npm start
	    Starts the development server.

	  npm run build
	    Bundles the app into static files for production.

	  npm test
	    Starts the test runner.

	  npm run eject
	    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
	    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

	We suggest that you begin by typing:

	  cd linx
	  npm start

	Happy hacking!


cd /tmp/react/linx/

npm start
